**Background Problem**
>In every single company we know that employees is the biggest asset that company ever had itself, despite the company had an advance , smartest technology , and many more asset that they ever had, but all of they had is useless if they dont have a good, smart, talented employees. In this Exploratory Data Analysis, I have a several question about employees satisfaction.  
1.Did employees level have a big effect of they **satisfaction**?
2. Did employees last rating still have a big effect of they next **satisfaction**? ( example : if one employee gives **bad result**, then the next result will be **good**? or if one employee gives **bad** result in the past then they have a **certification**, **reward** and the **salary** increases could give **good** result in the next ?  
3.Was the **location** of employees have an effect with they **satisfaction**?  
4.Was the **age** of employees could give effect with they **satisfaction**?  

**Goals**
1. Could we predict who is the employee is not **satisfied** based on this dataset?
